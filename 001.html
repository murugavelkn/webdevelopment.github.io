			Your rank O you who enhance all qualities.<br>
			<br>
			Your name heads the tome of the immortals,<br>
			First and in the highest lines.<br>
			<br>
			By your name alone you teach the wise,<br>
			The alpha and omega, O Symbol of Steadiness.<br>
			<br>
			Long live O (Maktoum) of the shining countenance,<br>
			By which we travel on dark nights.<br>
			<br>
			Generosity from you learned two things,<br>
			Generous patience and nobility.<br>
			<br>
			Rain, ocean and lions in their dens,<br>
			Take from you lessons so clear.<br>
			<br>
			And the sky and the mountains unbending,<br>
			Have drawn upon your glory and stature.<br>
			<br>
			And you taught nights and years,<br>
			To obey you gladly and willingly.<br>
			<br>
			Our Sheikh to whom we owe gratitude,<br>
			Creator of the nation's glories.<br>
			<br>
			I confirm that you are without peer,<br>
			And nights* cannot bring forth your equal.<br>
			<br>
			The moon and the sun, like me, confirm,<br>
			That your light illuminates darkness.<br>
			<br>
			Your description, none will capture,<br>
			Beyond description, not limited to traits.<br>
			<br>
			* Meaning time<br>
